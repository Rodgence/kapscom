            <b>AIR DUCT INSPECTION</b><br>
            Ducts are sources of airflow, which deliver and remove air from you home and help keep
            residents comfortable. If the ducts were not properly installed or maintained, they will
            likely become dirty and eventually need to be serviced or replaced. It is difficult to see for
            yourself if mold/dust exists or if there has been an infestation of pests, which is why
            KapsCom Africa offers duct inspections. <br><br>Poorly cleaned ducts can lead to indoor air quality
            issues and other health concerns that come with it. Another issue with ducts is
            inefficiency through holes or other obstructions. This can cause your fanâ€™s motor to run
            24/7 trying to keep up and overheat, causing issues that require repairs on your HVAC
            system. <br>By having KapsCom Africa look over and solve your issues, it could lower your
            monthly bill by a decent margin, depending on the issue. If you are concerned about your
            ducts leaking or needing to be cleaned, ask our HVAC experts for advice.
