            <b>KAPSCOM AFRICA</b> has included biometric systems in its Access Control
            configurations four years ago. This provides solutions and makes it possible for
            the system to be integrated according to the scenarios provided by the
            customer. The systems are therefore installed based on the risk analysis carried
            out by our company to provide turnkey solutions with an optimum equipment
            configuration. <br><br>Biometric devices, used as stand-alone or integrated systems are
            designed by making use of the measurable unique physical human
            characteristics for identity verifications. Biometric solutions that utilize
            measurable unique human body parts are as follows: Finger Print Identification
            System, Face Recognition System, Iris Identification System, Retina
            Identification System, Hand Geometry Identification System and Vein (Fist)
            Identification System.
