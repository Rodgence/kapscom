            The Car Plate Recognition Systems consists of an image processing technology used to identify
            motor vehicles by their registration plates. It can be used for a number of purposes some of
            which are explained below:
            </p>

            <p>
            Identification of stolen vehicles: An updated list of stolen motor vehicles issued by the security forces is loaded
            in the database of the GPRS and cameras installed on roads take photos of registration plates. Then, the images
            are compared with the content of the database and the results are notified to security forces in real time to
            allow them to catch the offenders. The system is able to identify motor vehicles going at 160 km/h in 30
            milliseconds by means of cameras and to rapidly consult the database and to determine the speed of the motor
            vehicle in question, to identify international registration plates and to archive motor vehicles by their original
            colors. The system works under all weather conditions day and night.

                Parking lot surveillance: This technology permits to load registration plates of motor vehicles authorized to
                enter the parking lot of the building in the database of the GPRS, which controls the gates, the automatic
                barriers, the bollards and road blockers in accordance with these data. <br><br>The system transfers all information
                regarding the surveillance of the parking lot on a monitor and issues reports containing all of the statistical
                information on the motor vehicles. This system can be used in free parking lots available only to authorized
                people as well as in parking lots with a charge with a subscription system.

                </p>

                <p>
                Control of motor vehicles at borders: Car plates and passport details of people crossing the border are
                registered in the database of the GPRS to ensure the control of crossings as well as the circulation of motor
                vehicles within the country. The system covers all of the border gates of the country and checks all border
                crossings. Eventual passages of criminals (terrorism, smuggling etc.) are monitored by means of the database of
                the security forces.
