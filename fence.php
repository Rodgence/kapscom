            ELECTRIC FENCE SOLUTIONS

            Will an electric fence keep people or animal out?
            Electric fences are a safe and effective deterrent for humans,
            wildlife, and intruders. They make perimeter security much more
            secure and simpler to maintain. An electric fence is a system of wires
            and equipment capable of delivering an electrical shock when
            touched by humans or animals.

            What happens if a person or animal touches an electric fence?
            For the most part, touching a properly-installed electric fence can
            lead to a harmless shock as the electricity passes through the system
            via a series of pulses, allowing the person or animal to disengage
            immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
            How powerful are electric fences?
            Electric fence energisers put out high voltage (around 8,000 volts),
            but very low amperage or current (around 120 milliamps). This is
            120-thousands of an amp. It should not even kill a squirrel.
