    Fire alarm systems have detectors that detect the onset of the fire and this makes
early intervention possible. Based on the evacuation plans of the protected building,
exit points like emergency exits, turnstiles, barriers at parking lots and other road
barriers and hydraulic passage control posts are set loose automatically. The power
supply for many locations may be offset to prevent the fire from expanding.
