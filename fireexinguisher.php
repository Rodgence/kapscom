        FIRE EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS
      </h1>
       <div class="col-md-6">
            <p><b>KAPSCOM AFRICA</b> installs fire extinguishing systems using technologies and gases permitted by
                   standards. This system is ideal for protecting precious and delicate rooms Data processing
                    centers where precious equipment and data archives are kept. It is also ideal for protecting chemical
                      materials that may react violently with water. <br><b>KAPSCOM AFRICA</b> can, upon request, integrate fire
                    extinguishing systems with other electronic detection and automation systems. Our company designs
                  systems of various designs and sizes depending on the requirements of the customer. Operating
                  scenarios provided by the customer and the risk analysis carried out by our engineers is also taken into
                  account during the designing process. The completed project is delivered as a turnkey an optimum
                  equipment configuration.

      <p>Fixed detection fire extinguishing systems are available in two categories: electronic
(detection) and mechanical (extinguishing). By virtue of the Protocol of Montreal signed
in 1987, it is forbidden to use HALON 1301 gas for fire extinguishing purposes. Though
the gas is very effective for extinguishing fire, it has very negative effects on the ozone
layer. This gas was withdrawn from markets gradually before being banned completely in
1994.</p> 

<p>Since then, the gases FM200, FE 13, Argon and CO2 have been used as means of fire
extinguishing. However, in the automatic fire extinguishing systems, each gas used in the
total flooding applications has its own merits and demerits. Therefore, it is a good idea to
have a good understanding of the requirements in order to make the best choice of
gases.</p>
