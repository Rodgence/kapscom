                    Intercom systems with or without image transmission are installed in the
                    most suitable places to ensure entrance security. They can be used as
                    stand-alone or networked depending on the number of users and of
                    entrances to be managed. Depending on the existing wirings of the building
                    or by the request from the customer analog or digital intercom systems can
                    be installed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Depending on installed configurations, the system permits
                    host-visitor communication or communication between occupants of the
                    same building or communication between a caretaker and visitors. In
                    residential estates and condominiums, the system permits communication
                    between the occupants of apartments and the security staff and visitors.
                    Designs are normally carried out according to the chosen option and the
                    budget of the customer.
