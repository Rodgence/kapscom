            <b>KAPSCOM AFRICA</b> designs outdoor Perimeter Intrusion Detection Systems, the outer ring of an
            electronic security system, according to the operating scenario provided by the customer and
            the risk analysis carried out by the engineers of our company in order to deliver turnkey
            solutions. <br><br>The systems for the perimeter intrusion detection systems, that part of the protected
            premises which is most exposed to the outside (gardens, walls, fences etc.), ensure security all
            along the line surrounding the premises. <br><br>It is integrated with the system of other electronic
            security systems and ensures the monitoring and recording of a threat. The cameras
            automatically turn towards the site of the intrusion. The system archives the images and other
            data and alarms for eventual retrospective investigations separately for each operator.

            At the stage of design of a perimeter intrusion detection system, we take into account the physical,
            topographical and structural properties of the area to be protected to choose one or several of the
            following solutions:<br>
            • Linear perimeter protection with double or four beams by means of external type active IR
            barrier sensors<br>
            • Protection of open areas by means of external type passive IR sensors<br>
            • Protection of large and open areas by means of microwave fence sensors<br>
            • Over-the-fence sensor system with Intrepid micro-point cable<br>
            • Volumetric sensor system with Intrepid micro-track cable<br>
            • Over-the-fence sensor system with microphone cable<br>
            • Over-the-fence sensor system with fiber optic cable<br>
            • Area protection system with electromagnetic cable<br>
            • Area protection system with electrostatic sensors<br>
