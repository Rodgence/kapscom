            Satellite television is television programming delivered by the means of
            communications satellite and received by an outdoor antenna, usually a parabolic
            mirror generally referred to as a satellite dish, and as far as household usage is
            concerned, a satellite receiver either in the form of an external set-top box or a satellite
            tuner module built into a TV set. <br>Satellite TV tuners are also available as a card or a USB
            stick to be attached to a personal computer. In many areas of the world satellite
            television provides a wide range of channels and services, often to areas that are not
            serviced by terrestrial or cable providers.

            Direct-broadcast satellite television comes to the general public in two distinct flavors -
            analog and digital. This necessitates either having an analog satellite receiver or a digital
            satellite receiver. Analog satellite television is being replaced by digital satellite
            television and the latter is becoming available in a better quality known as highdefinition television.
