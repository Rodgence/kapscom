             X-RAY SECURITY SCREENING SYSTEMS
        </h1>

                These are used at entrances of buildings for the passage control of parcels,
                luggage, bags and other similar objects to detect any weapons or explosives and
                to ensure the required security level for the building. The dimensions of the
                tunnel may vary between 82 cm x 65 cm and 80 cm x 100 cm depending on the
                intensity of the passage of luggage of the building. Thanks to the two-dimension
                detection system, all of the objects passing through the tunnel can be checked
                without any loss of image on the edges. They are able to see through 29-mmthick steel.

            <p>
                The main property of the X-ray security screening systems is their capability of
                distinguishing colors and of isolating images by using organic/inorganic double
                monitors to make the distinction between organic and inorganic matters with
                four colors to detect organic-based explosives. These detectors give a sound
                alarm upon detection of a suspicious piece of luggage and record the passages
                exhibiting a high alarm level in a digital recording device by means of a camera
                and transmit the data into a database.
